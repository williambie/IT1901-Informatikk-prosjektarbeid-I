# Sourcecode for the user interface

The user interface is simplistic look containing a list and a form for the user to add new events. The list is automatically filled with all events currently stored in the application. The list accepts user input and adds new events to the list if the user has filled out the form with valid values.

 - **AppController** - Connects the user interface with the logic from the domain layer  
 - **EventApp** - This file is used to launch the application
